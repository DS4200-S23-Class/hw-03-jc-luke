                            <li>This channel is a good choice because red and blue are the typical colors to represent the Republican and Democratic political parties, respectively; red is a color that pops out to the human eye; red and blue are two colors that contrast well and do a good job of separating distinct groups; and each color appears equally saturated.</li>

                            <li>This channel is a good choice because it accurately represents the sizes of each state besides Alaska; nevertheless, including Alaska is helpful to convey the message to the viewer.</li>

                            <li>This channel is a mediocre choice because although it's easy for the viewer to differentiate the pink from the orange, it's difficult to pinpoint each shade of color. Also, in terms of the white dots, it's difficult to discern whether they represent the background of the image or average scoring value.</li>
